The host computer can be connected to a router via an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The target board should be connected to the router via an ethernet cable. Please refer to the following connection diagram. | All the TCP/IP Application Demonstration projects that are part of this distribution use the Microchip hardware development boards. They are pre-configured with specific PHY Drivers. The default PHY driver can be changed as some of the hardware boards support different PHY daughter boards. To use a different PHY for a specific board, use MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to select and configure the PHY. Make sure that correct PHY address and configuration flags are used for the particular PHY daughter board. The MII/RMII and I/O configuration flags should match the hardware for the PHY board. The TCP/IP application demonstrations assume that IPv4 is enabled. If IPv4 is not enabled in MHC, the code in app.c will not build and needs to be updated to remove the IPv4 dependencies. | All the demos have DHCP enabled, and expect a DHCP server to be available. If there is no DHCP server, then the default static IP address will be used: 192.168.100.11. If this static address does not match your network settings, use MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to modify the static IP address of the network interface. | The NetBIOS name of the TCP/IP application is specified during the initialization of TCP/IP stack. It is the hostName member of TCPIP_HOSTS_CONFIGURATION structure. The NetBIOS service must be enabled in demonstration configuration, for the TCP/IP demonstration to respond to NetBIOS queries. Alternatively, use the IPv4 or IPv6 address (if IPv6 is enabled) of the board directly. | The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be obtained by running the TCP/IP Discovery utility on the computer. It requires the TCP/IP Announce module enabled in demonstration configuration, through MHC. | . ",

The root layer project shows that UART2 peripheral is selected to do read and write operation for TCP/IP commands. This is the basic configuration with SYS_CONSOLE, SYS_DEBUG and SYS_COMMAND modules. These modules are required for TCP/IP command execution. TCP sockets calculate the ISN using the wolfSSL crypto library. FreeRTOS component is required for the Freertos demo.

Telnet connection can be used for various system and TCP/IP related commands, just as the regular system console is used. The NetBIOS Name Service(NBNS) protocol associates host names with IP addresses. SNTP module updates its internal time periodically using a public global time server. The system timer module provides much better accuracy (since it is driven by a hardware clock) and resolution, and should be used for measuring timeouts and other internal requirements. The commands currently implemented and processed by the command processor can be dynamically updated, new commands can be added, etc. See the tcpip_commands.c file for the list of TCP/IP-related commands. Announce module to discover the Microchip devices within a local network. DHCP Client module to discover the IPv4 address from the nearest DHCP Server.
