the regular system console is used The NetBIOS Name Service(NBNS) protocol associates host names with IP addresses SNTP module updates its internal time periodically using a public global time server The system timer module provides much better accuracy (since it is driven by a hardware clock) and resolution and should be used for measuring timeouts and other internal requirements The commands currently implemented and processed by the command processor can be dynamically updated new commands can be added etc See the tcpip_commands c file for the list of TCP/IP-related commands

demonstration project on the target board If the board has a UART connection: A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector Open a standard terminal application on the computer (like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term) and configure the virtual COM port Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board This will be printed on the serial port terminal Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board Run tcpip_discoverer jar to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board Execution : Open the Telnet or UART2 session to get the console output After the successful broad bring up the console output for telnet session provides the output The below diagram shows the UART console output UART2 Output - tcpip_tcp_client_project Telnet Output - tcpip_tcp_client_project For TCP Client test input the following command from the serial port: Open the telnet session with the board IP address openurl url - The url argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance http://www microchip com/ For this above URL the DNS module will make a DNS query Then it will open a connection to the requested URL and perform a simple HTTP GET command The response received from the server will be printed on the terminal application through the serial port The expected output - tcpip_tcp_client_project "];
